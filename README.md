# Maritime_trade_algorithm

This was a small project to build a maritime trade algorithm based on publicly available 
data pertaining to ship traffic, choke points, conflicts, and many more parameters involved with 
the complex nature of shipping and shipping routes. With this data we were able to replicate and 
accurately predict global upwinds or down turns specific to shipping index's on the global 
capital markets.
