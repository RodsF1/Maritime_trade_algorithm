# World Trade Predictor


## Getting started

To get started developing, run the following command:

```{powershell}
nox
```

This should start the process of dependency resolution, and eventually create the file called requirements.lock.txt.  Then every version listed in that file with the given details will be installed into venv.

To activate the venv, simply run 

```{powershell}
.\.venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

on windows.  Then you are all set to go!  Install that jupyter vscode extension (see the file `.vscode/extensions.json`) and you are off to the races.
